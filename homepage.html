	<p class="intro"> Hello my name is Sarah Nam, and I am a sophomore at Boston University, studying as a graphic design major. I have always been interested in the fine arts, and being able to pursue it and the finer intricacies of design is a dream come true for me. My art generally stems from things that I feel influence me, or things that represent me. Most of my pieces showcase my thoughts about myself and the emotions that I feel towards various subject matters. </p>
