<h1 class="lsd"> Descriptions </h1>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="new hopes"> New Hopes, 2019 </h2>
<p> Medium: Oil paint on canvas </p>
<p> Size: 16 x 24 </p>
<p> Life is like a rollercoaster. There are always ups and downs. Even if a bad thing
happens, I always want to see the good side of everything and believe that everything
happens for a reason. I wanted to share this hope with others who needed it. I always
thought the patterns of the marbles in my room were interesting so I decided to show this
meaning in an art piece using them. In this piece, the colorful umbrella and marbles in the
front and the broken umbrella with dark marbles in the back represent bad things that
happen, but there’s always hope in the foreground when you take the time to look. I
submitted it to the Congressional Art Competition so I could share the story with more
people. Luckily, I placed second and got to share the story with Congresswoman Madeleine
Dean and other audiences at the award ceremony. Currently, this art piece is displayed at a
Congressional office in Washington D.C. </p>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="unlimited"> Unlimited, 2020 </h2>
<p> Medium: Oil paint on canvas </p>
<p> Size: 30 x 40 </p>
<p> Time is limited. You can use it in any way you want whether you want to waste it or you
can use it to make the most out of your life. For this piece, I got inspired by the marbles in my
room because of their pattern. I wanted to share the meaning of "unlimited-ness" of life. Even
though time is limited, there are unlimited ways to use it. I decided to use symbolism to
represent that. First, I put the galaxy. Then, to connect marbles and galaxy, the marbles are
turning into solar systems that follow into the broken clock. I personally think that it’s a very
fun piece since it directs the audience' eyes into so many different ways. The repetition of
the circle also makes this piece more entertaining. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="mom"> Mom's Spaghetti, 2018 </h2>
<p> Medium: Acrylic on canvas </p>
<p> Size: 24 x 30 </p>
<p> This painting is from my perspective as a teenage girl. I know that my mom is trying to
look out for me and only wants what is best, such as good food. However, this puts a lot of
pressure on me and causes stress. In this image, my mother has created a delicious and
healthy meal for me but has not realized that in doing so, she has trapped me inside of the
container that is constantly being shaken. I’ve focused on the composition and volume in
this art piece so it’s more entertaining to the audience. I got first place at Upper Dublin
School District Allied Art Show and honorable mention at a New York Korea Times Art
Contest. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="childhood memory"> Childhood Memory, 2019 </h2>
<p> Medium: mixed media (colored pencil, watercolor, styrofoam board to create the box) Included real objects to photograph </p>
<p> This is one of my favorite pieces. The best childhood memory that I have is every
Christmas, spending time with my family and exchanging gifts. I first drew the bow to study
reflective objects and made the Christmas themed box using a styrofoam board. Then, I
wanted to add meaning to this piece so I drew my future self reflecting on an ornament to
show my old self missing childhood. To get a perfect photograph while showing the
meaning, I've created the inside portion of the box and put real toys and objects from my
childhood. I think I love this piece because it's very personal and it represents me well. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="louie"> Louie </h2>
<p> Medium: Oil paint on canvas </p>
<p> Size: 16 x 20 </p>
<p> This was painted for one of my nail salon customers who lost her dog. It was a way for
me to comfort her. I wanted her to have something to remember him by. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="lexi"> Lexi, 2019 </h2>
<p> Medium: Oil paint on canvas </p>
<p> Size: 18 x 24 </p>
<p> This was my third dog painting as my business. I opened up my own business of selling
passed away pet portraits to cure people's wounds of losing their pets. I focused on the
details of her hair and the texture of her body. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="whoiam"> Who I Am, 2021 </h2>
<p> Medium: Charcoal </p>
<p> Size: 16 x 20 </p>
<p> Self-portrait. This was my first time trying charcoal and it was very interesting since it
was very different in terms of texture. I focused on the details, balance, and contrast. </p>
</div>

<div class="top">
<h2 id="nude"> Nude by Euan Uglow Mastercopy, 2021 </h2>
<p> Medium: Ink </p>
<p> Size: 16 x 20 </p>
<p> This is a mastercopy of Nude by Euan Uglow. It was my first time trying to create an artwork with ink. </p>
